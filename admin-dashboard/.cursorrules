# Padel Space - Admin Dashboard (Next.js)

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4
- Icons: Lucide React
- Components: Shadcn UI (MANDATORY for all UI components)
- State Management: React Query / TanStack Query (for server state)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)

## UI Component Guidelines (Shadcn UI)
- **MANDATORY**: Always check if a Shadcn component exists before building a custom one.
- **Installation**: Use `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]` to add new components.
- **Customization**: When customizing Shadcn components, maintain the Padel Space brand (rounded corners 8-12px, high contrast).
- **Forms**: Use Shadcn's `Form` (react-hook-form + zod) for all data entry, including Quick Booking and User Search.
- **Tables**: Use Shadcn's `Table` or `Data Table` for customer lists and booking history.
- **Feedback**: Use Shadcn's `Toast` or `Sonner` for success/error notifications.
- **Overlays**: Use Shadcn's `Dialog` (Modal) or `Sheet` (Sidebar) for the Quick Booking interface.

## Project Context
The Admin Dashboard is a specialized tool for managers and staff of Padel Space center in Serbia. It allows for real-time court management, quick bookings, and business analytics.

## UI/UX Guidelines
- **Branding**: Match Padel Space energetic/space theme.
- **Colors**: 
  - Primary: Hot Pink (#FF0099)
  - Secondary: Deep Navy (#1a2332)
  - Accents: Lime Green (#CCFF00) for availability/success.
- **Typography**: Montserrat (Google Fonts).
- **Layout**: High density but legible. Admins need to see a lot of data at once (especially the daily schedule).
- **Responsiveness**: Primary focus on Desktop (for center reception), but must be usable on tablets.

## Core Features Context
1. **Daily Schedule**: A grid view showing all courts (columns) and time slots (rows). Use Shadcn's `ScrollArea` and `Card` components for the grid items. Must use Realtime subscriptions to reflect changes from the mobile app immediately.
2. **Quick Booking**: Use Shadcn's `Dialog` or `Sheet` for creating bookings in < 10 seconds. Should allow selecting existing users or entering guest details.
3. **Customer Search**: Use Shadcn's `Command` or `Input` with a popover for global search. View their booking history using `DataTable`.
4. **Revenue Dashboard**: Visual charts showing daily/weekly/monthly revenue based on confirmed bookings.
5. **Court Management**: Toggle court status (Active, Maintenance, Unavailable) with immediate effect on the mobile app.

## Database Integration (Supabase)
- The database is shared with the `rez_padel` Flutter app.
- Refer to `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` in the root for table structures.
- Use Supabase Auth for staff login. Only users with role `staff` or `admin` should access this dashboard.
- Leverage Supabase Realtime for the schedule grid.

## Serbian Market Specifics
- **Language**: All user-facing text in Serbian Latin.
- **Currency**: RSD (Serbian Dinar).
- **Timezone**: Europe/Belgrade (CET/CEST).
- **Date Formatting**: DD.MM.YYYY.

## Best Practices
- Use Server Components where possible for initial data fetching.
- Implement robust error boundaries and loading states (Skeletons).
- Maintain consistency with the mobile app's business logic (e.g., price calculation).
- Keep the UI energetic and professional, avoiding "boring" corporate styles.
