# Rez Padel - Booking Management SaaS for Padel Space

## Tech Stack
- Flutter (UI framework)
- Dart (programming language)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, realtime)
- Supabase Edge Functions (serverless backend functions)

## Project Context
Building a booking management app for Padel Space, a padel center in Serbia. 

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use Flutter best practices and Material Design 3
- Follow Dart naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Organize code with feature-first architecture
- Use Riverpod for state management (flutter_riverpod)
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Use Supabase client for all backend operations

## Supabase Integration
- Use environment variables for Supabase URL and anon key
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication
- Leverage Realtime subscriptions for live court availability
- Store images in Supabase Storage

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Follow PadelSpace branding (cosmic/space theme)
- Primary colors: Hot Pink (#FF0099), Deep Navy (#1a2332)
- Typography: Montserrat via Google Fonts (ExtraBold for headings, Regular for body)
- High contrast design (pink on navy, white on navy)
- Energetic, playful aesthetic targeting millennials/Gen Z
- Use rounded corners (8-12px) for buttons and cards
- Implement responsive design for various screen sizes

## Design Patterns
- Use bold typography hierarchy
- Generous white space
- Playful decorative elements (floating padel balls in lime green)
- Action shots with dark navy overlays for text legibility
- CTA buttons: Pink background, white text, rounded corners

## Serbian Market Specifics
- All user-facing text in Serbian Latin (no localization system needed)
- Handle RSD (Serbian Dinar) currency formatting
- Consider local time zones (CET/CEST - Europe/Belgrade)
- Energetic, friendly tone in communications

## User Roles
- **Players** - Book courts, view availability, manage bookings
- **Staff** - Manage bookings for their center, check-in players
- **Admin** - Full system access (CEO of PadelSpace and development team)

## Best Practices
- Write clean, maintainable code with comments
- Create reusable widgets and components
- Implement loading states and error handling
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Test critical user flows

## Things to Avoid
- Don't use muted or pastel colors (stick to brand palette)
- Avoid serif fonts
- Don't create low contrast combinations
- Avoid rigid, corporate layouts
